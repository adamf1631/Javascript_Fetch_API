# Javascript_Fetch_API

You'll need your own API key for this from

https://openweathermap.org

then take your key and put it in the index.js file in the js folder being careful to leave the "&" in that variable.

Then the user will be able to type in a zip code and get the weather without a page reload.

I did not add any conditional logic a.k.a. if/else statements to make sure they enter something into the text field but feel free to add it to yours if youd like.

Although technically it does that anyway since the fetch api call cant retrieve any info without the number for the zip code.
